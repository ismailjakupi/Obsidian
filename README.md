# obsidian README

This theme is a theme inspired by obsidian (the vulcanic material).

It's a Dark purple-ish theme, it's my first theme so don't expect it to be amazing or fully configured as I'm still learning everything

It's going to undergo some testing and checks in the next few weeks so the releases and maintenance will kind of be rough and frequent.
